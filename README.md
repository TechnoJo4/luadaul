Daul is a language that compiles to Lua and LuaJIT bytecode.

Some examples are available in the `examples` directory.

Current State: Lots of TODOs, missing important Lua features, a bit of spaghetti, and probably bugs.

## Roadmap

Most of these goals are very long-term, but they should serve as an idea of what I strive to achieve with daul:
  - [ ] All Lua features
  - [ ] Complete Lua 5.1 bytecode backend
  - [ ] Complete LuaJIT bytecode backend
  - [ ] Inline functions
  - [ ] Self-hosting
  - [ ] Well-documented codebase
  - [ ] Type checking
  - [ ] Custom operators
  - [ ] Macros

# daul

A language that compiles to Lua bytecode.

Warning: The compiler depends on LuaJIT, but the emitted bytecode is Lua 5.1 bytecode, which is imcompatible with LuaJIT.

Current State: Lots of TODOs (and not enough of other kinds of comments), missing important features, spaghetti, and very likely bugs.
